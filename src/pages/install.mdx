# Installation

## Fully Supported OS

We support LTS and current releases of Debian and Ubuntu, as well as releases that are going to be GA soon.

Running on an ARM64 platform is currently an experimental feature, but we plan to keep supporting it in the long term.

Trixie is now compiled with PCRE2 and a later version of http_lua module. Highly experimental, please report issues.

## Install via DEB

```sh
apt install -y lsb-release ca-certificates apt-transport-https curl gnupg dpkg
curl -sS https://n.wtf/public.key | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/n.wtf.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/n.wtf.gpg] https://mirror-cdn.xtom.com/sb/nginx/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/n.wtf.list
apt update
apt install -y nginx-extras
```

## Install from Docker

Check out [Docker image for nginx-docker](https://github.com/u-sb/nginx-docker).

## Unsupported OS

* Debian 10 Buster <br /><SecondaryText>Last update 1.27.1-2nwtf+331</SecondaryText>
* Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic (LTS) <br /><SecondaryText>Last update 1.27.1-2nwtf+331</SecondaryText>
* Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar <br /><SecondaryText>Last update 1.27.1-2nwtf+331 - this is the final update</SecondaryText>
* Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic <br /><SecondaryText>Last update 1.27.1-2nwtf+331 - this is the final update</SecondaryText>

We do not provide full and long term support for legacy OS, but you can use it at your own risk. Unsupported OS will not always get the latest update and is on a resonable efforts basis - we may stop updating them at any time.

Release that is tagged as <SecondaryText>this is the final update</SecondaryText> will no longer receive updates.

``` sh
apt install -y apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates curl gnupg
curl https://n.wtf/public-rsa.key | apt-key add -
curl https://n.wtf/public.key | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://mirror-cdn.xtom.com/sb/nginx/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/n.wtf.list
apt update
apt install -y nginx-extras
```
